Using a remote repository

If you are working with someone else
or working in different locations with
different computers, you may want to 
use a remote repository rather 
than keeping your work only local. 

Manual vs Automatic pull

It would be advantageous to pull
changes manually rather than 
automatically in case there are 
any changes you actually don't want
committed to the repository.
